We can't sell it in the traditional sense where users can download the app and connect with their other 
applications and have their own bot. That would probably violate a thousand terms and conditions by 
application provider and also move us further away from our goal of being a decentralized AI platform.

Hence some of the strategies we can use if we ever decide to fundraise or get into the market are:

- Paywalling the latest version of the software
- Commercial license (royalties from people using our software commercially)
- Providing easy to deploy private cloud servers for users
- Integration with blockchain
